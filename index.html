	<h1> My Website </h1>
	<p> My name is Shaun Lazaro, and I am a student learning programming as a hobby.
	This website was created to list all of my projects, and a way to learn
	basic web design with HTML and CSS.
	It was also created in anticipation for a highschool application. </p>
	<p><em> Currently, I know standard/intermediate desktop program development with <strong>C#</strong>,
		basic mobile app development with <strong>Java</strong>, and basic
		web design using <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>.</em> </p>
	<p> Latest Release </p>
	<p><a href= "http://puffleparty.github.io"> Puffle Party Of Canada HQ - Political Party Website </a> </p>
	<p> As part of a school project, we were to create a political party. The political
		party our group created was the <b>Puffle Party of Canada, or PPOC</b>. I created a
		website for the party, and I thought it would be a good way to showcase my current
		progress in web design, without redoing this website </p>
	<p> Projects In Development: </p>
	<p><a href= "ontrack.html"> OnTrack Productivity App - <b>Focus</b> </a></p>
	<p> OnTrack Focus is <b>Currently Ready For Testing, </b> and Ontrack as a project is currently being reorganized.
		Ontrack Handy has been removed, and more focus will be put into Ontrack Study, the flash card app.
		Currently, the mediafire link leads to an old, broken version of Ontrack, a more current version
		can be found on the shaunlazaro github profile. As usual, any bug reports going to my email
		are appreciated. </p>
